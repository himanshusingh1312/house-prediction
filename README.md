# Real Estate Price Prediction Project




## Introduction

Creating a Machine Learning model to predict the home prices in Bangalore, India. We are going to use the dataset from Kaggle.com. We are also going to create a single page website which will provide the front end to access our model for predictions.

Below data science concepts are used in this project

* Data loading and cleaning
* Outlier detection and removal
* Feature engineering
* Dimensionality reduction
* Gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning
* K fold cross validation

## Technology
* #### Python
* ####  Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
* ####  Matplotlib for data visualization
* ####  Sklearn for model building
* ####  Google Colaboratory Notebook
*  #### Python flask for http server
* ####  HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI

## Steps
* We will first build a model using sklearn and linear regression using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com.
* Second step would be to write a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests.
* Third component is the website built in html, css and javascript that allows user to enter home square ft area, bedrooms etc and it will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price.
